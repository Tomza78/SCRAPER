    "selftext": "Wanted to share some observations on what's been happening in Chinese tech since DeepSeek's R1 model shook the market in January 2025. The data paints an interesting picture for anyone considering China tech exposure.  \nSince DeepSeek demonstrated that frontier AI could be trained for a fraction of US costs, Chinese tech stocks have added over $1.3 trillion in market cap as of Feb 2025. The Hang Seng Tech Index gained 23% in 2025, yet it still trades below its historical median P/E multiple. At the start of 2026, Goldman Sachs explicitly recommended 'overweighting Chinese equities' in its latest research report. Meanwhile, several other global institutions, including Fidelity International, UBS, and Invesco, have also expressed a bullish outlook on Chinese assets for the year ahead.\n\nThe more compelling story is in the domestic AI chip ecosystem. Cambricon Technologies, which makes chips that DeepSeek's models natively support, guided full year 2025 revenue of 6 to 7 billion yuan, up over 410% from 1.17 billion yuan in 2024, with net profit of 1.85 to 2.15 billion yuan versus a loss of 452 million yuan the prior year, marking its first annual profit since listing. The company currently trades at a market cap of roughly $60 billion, down from a peak above $70 billion. Several other AI chip companies including Biren, MetaX, and Baidu's Kunlun chip unit are reportedly preparing IPOs.\n\nWhat makes the timing interesting is the growing speculation around DeepSeek's next major release. The R2 model was originally expected in mid-2025 but was delayed after founder Liang Wenfeng expressed dissatisfaction with performance. Part of the challenge was training difficulties on Huawei's Ascend chips, as Chinese authorities encouraged the company to reduce Nvidia dependence. They reportedly had to pivot back to Nvidia for training while using Huawei chips for inference.\n\nHowever, DeepSeek published a research paper on January 1st introducing a new training architecture that analysts describe as a breakthrough for scaling larger models more efficiently. Some analysts believe there may not be a standalone R2 and instead the improvements will be integrated into a V4 model. DeepSeek has historically published foundational research papers shortly before major model launches, so the timing is notable.\n\nThere's also chatter about a next-generation AI agent capable of executing multi-step tasks autonomously, potentially launching in Q1 2026. If DeepSeek manages another \"Sputnik moment\" with a new model release, it could drive another leg of re-rating across Chinese tech.\n\nFrom a portfolio construction perspective, the challenge is that most China tech ETFs available to US investors have limited exposure to the companies actually benefiting from this trend. KWEB has zero A-share exposure and is concentrated in internet names. CQQQ has broader coverage but caps A-share weight at 25% due to index rules. I've been looking at CNQQ which has roughly 50% A-share weight and actually holds names like Cambricon and other AI chip plays that are missing from the internet-focused funds. It's a newer fund so less liquidity, but the exposure profile is closer to what I'm looking for if the thesis is about AI infrastructure buildout rather than just consumer internet.\n\nThe risks are real and include regulatory uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and currency exposure. But the valuation gap versus US tech and the potential catalyst from new model releases make this worth watching.",

Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang called it \"the largest infrastructure buildout in human history,\" and demand for Blackwell chips + upcoming Rubin platform is \"sky high.\"\n\nRecent context: NVDA pulled back \\~10-15% from late-2025 highs (now trading around \\~$180-190 range after some volatility), amid broader tech sell-off fears on \"AI capex bubble\" concerns, competition (AMD, custom chips from hyperscalers), and high valuation debates. But fundamentals scream strength:\n\n* Dominance in AI accelerators (\\~90% market share in training/inference GPUs)\n* Hyperscalers' insane spend (Amazon $200B, Alphabet $175-185B, Meta $115-135B, MSFT on pace \\~$140-145B) directly benefits NVDA\n* Upcoming earnings (late Feb 2026) expected to show continued explosive growth (analysts eyeing $65B+ Q4 guidance beat potential)\n* Long-term tailwinds: AI factories scaling, software (Nvidia AI Enterprise), networking/DPUs all in-house\n\nThis is the ultimate \"picks and shovels\" play in the AI gold rush  even if end-demand monetization lags for some customers, Nvidia gets paid upfront on the hardware buildout.\n\nOn the flip side, valuation is stretched (high forward P/E vs historical), and if AI hype cools or hyperscalers slow spend (execution slips, ROI questions), NVDA could face sharper downside. Recent dip reflects some nervousness  same \"bubble\" talk we've seen across AI stocks.\n\n**I see this pullback as a solid entry point.** I've been adding to my NVDA position on Bitget stock futures during the weakness. After rotating part of my Gold  exposure (I took some profits on gold after its big pump) into big tech names late last year, I find NVDA offers compelling exposure right now: the undisputed leader in AI compute at a level where the massive $650B+ spend pipeline could drive serious upside, even if the market is cautious short-term.\n\nCurious to hear your takes:\n\n* Do you see NVDA as a very strong long-term winner from this AI CapEx tsunami, or do the valuation / bubble fears make you more cautious?\n* Adding here on the dip, or waiting for more weakness (e.g., below $170)?\n* Anyone else eyeing NVDA futures on Bitget or similar?\n* Other names benefiting from the same theme (TSM, ASML, or even the hyperscalers themselves)?\n\nNot financial advice just my view.

Even Vanguard thinks next ten years PE will outperform US equities ( [https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/vanguard\\_2025\\_midyear\\_private\\_equity\\_review\\_and\\_outlook.pdf](https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/vanguard_2025_midyear_private_equity_review_and_outlook.pdf) ).\n\nAdditionally,  private real estate income is tax advantaged. Given the real estate downturn since rise in interest rates, I think it's not a bad time to allocate more to commercial real estate. Distributions are offset by depreciation. You keep rolling to bigger syndications (in my case because I don't ever want to actively manage anything) with bigger distributions. [https://www.therealestatecrowdfundingreview.com/post/2018/02/12/how-to-invest-in-passive-real-estate-without-paying-a-penny-of-tax-legally-part-2-defer-d](https://www.therealestatecrowdfundingreview.com/post/2018/02/12/how-to-invest-in-passive-real-estate-without-paying-a-penny-of-tax-legally-part-2-defer-d)\n\nThe issue is with private markets there's information and access inefficiencies which have mostly disappeared with public markets. **To learn about alts and to get access to deal flow I have joined some groups but would appreciate if others have more suggestions.** Here's my opinion of the groups I have tried out:\n\n506 Investor Group ( [https://506investorgroup.com/](https://506investorgroup.com/) ): This in my opinion is the best of the bunch. They don't allow sponsors in. Investors discuss deal flow freely. It is free to join. They get discounts with several sponsors on fees. And they have an RIA ( [https://cornerstonealternatives.com/](https://cornerstonealternatives.com/) ) which only charges .25% fee for access to Private Equity, Private Credit etc.\n\nPrivate Investor Club ( [https://www.privateinvestorclub.com/](https://www.privateinvestorclub.com/) ): This group is also free. You learn a lot here as well from other members and see various deals. They do run some feeders but most of the discussions here are not about the feeders. Basically, mostly investors helping other investors with due Diligence.\n\nPassive Pockets ( [https://passivepockets.com/](https://passivepockets.com/) ): This one charges an annual fee. I have found the deal flow and discussions sub par so I didn't renew. Many of the sponsors who advertise with them are also subpar (they seem to have a higher miss rate than the other groups but obviously with real estate downturn there have been a lot more misses).\n\nBoulder Investor Group ( [https://boulderinvestmentgroup.com/](https://boulderinvestmentgroup.com/) ): This one has a small fee to join but is then free. They have around a deal or two a month often at preferred terms. I believe they get a fee from the sponsors who present to the group. Deals are not bad though but I have not yet invested.\n\nLongAngle ( [https://www.longangle.com/](https://www.longangle.com/) ) : This one is more lifestyle focused but they do have an offering or so a month. It is also free to join unless you want to pay extra for premier membership. They only allow discussion of their own feeders. They charge 1.27% for their feeders some of which are the same things you get from Cornerstone above for .25%. But the discussions are mostly not about the deals.\n\nAll of these groups have some sort of vetting. LongAngle vets for net worth, 506 and PIC to make sure you're not a sponsor, etc.\n\nI also jointed the LP-GP mailing list mostly to see more deals but frankly most of those deals have not been great.\n\nAnyway, **I appreciate if others suggestions for other groups to join.**",
