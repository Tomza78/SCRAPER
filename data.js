    "selftext": "The US national debt just crossed $38 trillion, and the pace is staggering nearly $1 trillion every 100 days. For context, debt was just $5.7 trillion in 2000 and barely $10 trillion after the 2008 financial crisis. Now the debt-to-GDP ratio is hovering around 120–125%, double the pre-2008 long-term average.\n\nWhat really matters for markets isn’t the headline number but the cost of servicing it. Net interest payments are approaching $1 trillion annually, projected to overtake defense spending if rates stay high. That puts three pressures on the system: more Treasury issuance hitting the market, higher yields required to attract buyers, and equity valuations facing stiff competition from risk-free yields. We’ve already seen 10-year yield spikes crush growth stocks in 2023–24.\n\nSo the key question is where the bond market draws the line. At what yield do equities start repricing structurally rather than temporarily? Is this a slow-burn risk for stocks, or background noise until a funding shock appears? Curious how others are positioning around US debt and bond yields.",

    "selftext": "The five largest hyperscalers (Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Oracle) are on track to spend $660-690 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026, which is nearly double 2025 levels and triple what they spent two years ago, and from what I can tell, this is the largest infrastructure spending surge relative to the revenue it's generating in modern history.\n\nJP Morgan apparently estimates the industry needs to generate $650 billion in annual AI revenue by 2030 to justify current spending levels. Pure-play AI revenue today? About $30 billion. So we're looking at an 18x gap, and honestly I spent a while trying to figure out if that gap is historically abnormal or just what early infrastructure cycles look like, so I went back through the telecom bubble, the dot-com crash, railroad mania, and pulled the financial signals that showed up before each one blew up: credit spreads, growth deceleration in the dominant infra provider, capex-to-cash-flow ratios, options flow, and some others that are more specific to this cycle like GPU spot pricing. Twelve signals total, here's what they're showing.\n\n**TL;DR:** The AI capex-to-revenue gap is wider than the telecom bubble's was in 1999, credit markets are pricing in rising default risk, NVIDIA's growth rate is decelerating even as revenue climbs, and the weakest links imo are the debt-loaded middlemen (CoreWeave) and the AI power stocks (CEG, VST, NRG) that priced in a decade of demand in 18 months - and I might be shorting these very soon.\n\n# The revenue gap\n\nThis is the number that got me started on this whole thing: Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Oracle are on track to spend roughly $660-690 billion on capex in 2026, nearly double their 2025 levels and triple what they spent two years ago, and the actual AI revenue being generated is a fraction of that. OpenAI ended 2025 at about $20 billion in ARR, Anthropic hit roughly $9 billion in early 2026, and even if you're generous with cloud AI revenue attribution across all the hyperscalers, JP Morgan says the industry needs to generate $650 billion in annual AI revenue by 2030 to justify current spending, so that's an 18x increase from where we are today.\n\nFrom my own work in the tech industry (I work in a reasonably large own-product tech company), I think most people seriously overestimate how much real enterprise value AI is generating right now, like an MIT study found 95% of companies see zero return on generative AI investments, and honestly that tracks with what I see day to day, most of the \"AI revenue\" these companies report is being generated at a loss anyway, so the actual gap between sustainable AI revenue and infrastructure spending is probably even worse than what the headline numbers suggest.\n\nFor some historical context on how this plays out: during the telecom bubble, companies laid hundreds of thousands of miles of fiber based on projected demand that took 15 years to show up, and by 2005, 85% of that fiber was still dark. It eventually got used, sure, but under new ownership, purchased at pennies on the dollar out of bankruptcy. The AI capex-to-revenue gap right now is wider than the telecom equivalent was in 1999. This doesn't mean that AI is useless, it just means that a market correction is incoming, the numbers are what worries me, overvaluation of the current usecases of this technology, if it will bear fruits in the future... yeah, sure, but rn it's overvalued.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ellkv2qk13kg1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=f163e70d3809cb1950e82dbd2d42a7e744bea5b6\n\n# NVIDIA's growth rate is decelerating (and nobody wants to hear it)\n\nPeople keep missing this, or maybe they just don't want to see it. NVIDIA is still growing. Q3 FY2026 revenue was $57 billion, up 62% YoY. But look at the trajectory:\n\n\\- FY2025 full year: +114% YoY\n\n\\- Q1 FY2026: +69% YoY\n\n\\- Q2 FY2026: +56% YoY (slowest in 9 quarters)\n\n\\- Q3 FY2026: +62% YoY (partial rebound, still below the prior trend)\n\nRevenue keeps climbing but the slope is flattening. I know, I know, \"the stock is still going up.\", but cisco's was too.\n\nCisco's revenue growth decelerated for two consecutive quarters before the dot-com crash. Still reporting record revenue. Analysts still raising price targets. The stock hit $80.06 in March 2000, then lost 89% over the next two years. Took 25 years to recover. It only passed that price again in December 2025. Twenty-five years.\n\nI'm not saying NVIDIA is Cisco since it has real margins and all, real products and actual demand behind the numbers (even tho tbh everything suggests that they're downplaying the consumer market in favour of going all in on the AI datacenters thing), but this pattern, growth deceleration preceding a correction in the dominant infrastructure provider, it just keeps showing up on every single cycle. The market prices in trajectory, not absolute level, and when the trajectory bends it doesn't matter how good the underlying business is.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3413846r13kg1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9959a8fcf524710a386a3a1e15b3a6e3f04a6c9\n\n# Credit markets are doing that thing they do before corrections\n\nThis is the part that I'm tracking the most attentively and will time my move: credit spreads have been the most reliable indicator of financial stress over the past 30 years, they widened before the dot-com crash, before the GFC and before COVID, and typically lead equities by 6-18 months.\n\nCoreWeave right now: $14-15 billion in debt. Nearly 4x its total revenue. CDS spreads more than doubled since October 2025. Senior notes at 9%+ interest. S&P rates it B+, Moody's Ba3. Speculative grade, and CoreWeave is not the only one, the top five hyperscalers raised a record $108 billion in debt in 2025, more than 3x the average over the prior nine years. AI-linked firms now make up 14% of the investment-grade bond index. Data center ABS (asset-backed securities) issuance hit $13.3 billion across 27 transactions in 2025, up 55% from 2024.\n\nBank of America calculated that hyperscalers would need to spend 94% of their operating cash flow to fund AI buildouts. Ninety-four percent. That's why they're turning to debt markets, they literally cannot fund this from operations.\n\nAnd the structures are getting... creative: off-balance-sheet SPVs, GPU-collateralized loans where the hardware has already lost 50-70% of its rental value and synthetic leases. One analyst at DA Davidson warned that the equity in CoreWeave shares \"may ultimately lose all its value since the entire value of the enterprise is owned by debt holders.\" That's not me being dramatic. That's a sell-side analyst.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/caqdziau13kg1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=be2516f3c779ce933cb733ad2810f1f1e67dd9d8\n\n# Capex is at telecom-bubble levels relative to cash flow\n\nBig tech capex as a percentage of EBITDA is running at 50-70%. For reference:\n\n\\- AT&T at the peak of the 2000 telecom bubble: 72%\n\n\\- Exxon at the peak of the 2014 energy bubble: 65%\n\n\\- Microsoft MRQ: \\~45%\n\n\\- Oracle MRQ: \\~57%\n\nThese companies used to be asset-light with huge free cash flow, money going back to shareholders through buybacks, and now? now they're turning into asset-heavy infrastructure operators: capex went from 4% of revenue to 15% since 2012. BCA Research calculated that the five hyperscalers plan to add $2 trillion in AI-related assets to their balance sheets by 2030, with annual depreciation of $400 billion. That's more than their combined profits in 2025. Read that again.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bbmt6tgx13kg1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=46ab4652cb59c9c96111bb9593a5479a96ddc670\n\nZuckerberg told investors Meta would \"simply pivot\" if the AGI spending strategy proves wrong. Cool. Meta also tripled its debt load in a single month.\n\nI think this part isn't even controversial if you look at history, it's pretty much a pattern. Every prior infrastructure cycle (telecom, railroads, energy) the companies building the infrastructure underperformed the companies that later used it. Telecom stocks crashed 92%. Still 60% below their peak, 25 years later. Netflix, Google, Facebook? All built on top of cheap, bankrupt-purchased fiber. The infrastructure got used. The investors that funded the infrastructure got wiped out.\n\n# What I'm betting against (kinda against the popular flow of betting against NVDA and PLTR)\n\nIf this corrects, it won't start with Microsoft, Google or NVIDIA as they definitely can absorb a slowdown, imo the fragility is in the middlemen, the ones that took on debt or priced in a decade of demand.\n\nCoreWeave is the obvious one: IPO'd at $40 in March 2025, hit $183 by June, collapsed 62% by December. $14-15 billion in debt on $3.6 billion in 2025 revenue, so 4x levered. Their interest expenses tripled from $75M in Q1 to $125M in Q3 with operating margins at 4%, which is less than half the interest rate on its own debt. CDS spreads doubled since October. S&P rates it B+. $4.2 billion in debt maturing in 2026, GPU collateral that's lost 50-70% of rental value, construction delays pushing hundreds of millions in revenue into future quarters while interest keeps accruing. DA Davidson analyst wrote that the equity \"may ultimately lose all its value since the entire value of the enterprise is owned by debt holders.\"\n\nTheir only salvation imo is pretty much a government bail-out, which is a real risk for any short play ofc.\n\nThe risk of a government bail-out is what will make me diversify my bet against the market: Constellation Energy (CEG), Vistra (VST), NRG Energy (NRG). Vistra was the #1 stock in the entire S&P 500 in 2024, up 258%. Constellation was #3, up 130%. NRG gained 78%.\n\nThese aren't utility returns, they're priced for a structural break in power demand that assumes every announced data center gets built and powered on schedule. Vistra peaked at $219 in September 2025, then dropped 19% in six months. CEG is down 21% YTD. Morningstar has a $52 fair value estimate on Vistra and it trades around $170. They're real assets, real contracts, sure, but they went from boring defensive plays to momentum trades priced for perfection, and if hyperscaler capex guidance gets cut, or even just grows slower than expected, I think these have the most air under them.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2wz1yu6223kg1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=395c3a5d0d2d51cb48f51901c992b6cae3c22a3f",

This isn’t speculative, it’s empirically documented across multiple generations of models. As long as $10B in compute produces a meaningfully smarter model than $1B, the ROI is driven by the technology itself. Companies aren’t spending on faith. They’re spending because the returns are mathematically observable. Supply is physically constrained. Fiber was a commodity. You could overbuild it because the inputs were abundant. High-end AI compute is bottlenecked by TSMC fabrication capacity and power grid availability. There are literal, physical limits on how many advanced chips can be produced. If you don’t invest $100B today, you cannot catch up in 2028 — the capacity simply won’t exist. That’s the opposite of a bubble dynamic. Bubbles are characterized by unlimited supply chasing speculative demand. AI capex is characterized by constrained supply chasing demonstrated demand.

Primarily mutual funds like vanguards VGTSX star fund and VTI.  The individual stocks are primarily large tech companies, about $100k worth.

But my risk is mitigated by my wife who earns more than I do and has no plans to retire.  \n\nBut ignoring that, from the many videos I've watched on retirement, a decent plan would be to build up to maybe 40% bonds (it's not so much a percentage as it is a buffer to live on for 2-3 years if the stock market crashes).  That's to protect against having to sell stocks in a down market, particularly in the early years of retirement before claiming SS.  The early years of retirement are by far the riskiest.  After claiming SS, then can reduce the bonds and get more aggressive if desired.  \n\nI'm trying to get to 2-2.5M by retirement age, including a good amount in a taxable brokerage acct to draw from first and cover some Roth conversion taxes.  Couple of people I listen to on Youtube are Kevin Lum and Rob Berger... both have good content on retirement planning and are easy to listen to.",
