    "selftext": "Pinterest is a tool. Snapchat is a network. It’s much easier to abandon one tool if an alternate tool feels like an upgrade. Why use your original hammer if a new one feels better and is more practical. Abandoning a network means saying goodbye to your 5-year-old chat history and \"best friends\" list. It’s like moving from one neighborhood to another. Taking your kid out of school and moving them to another one. \n\nSo, okay- governments are talking about banning Snapchat for 13-15 year olds. Yeah, making something a forbidden fruit is going to make it less exciting. No, lol. Besides, SNAP hardly makes any advertisement money from that age group. Their key segment is 18-24 year olds of which they’ve reached 90 % of in the US. \n\nPinterest is a healthier business. But they don’t have a loyal user base. \n\nInstagram, TikTok can thrive in co-existence with Snapchat. \n\nPinterest can’t co-exist if businesses don’t want to pay for advertising. \n\nSnapchat has 24 million paid subscribers. A year ago they had 9 million paid subscribers. Next year they’ll approach 50 million paid subscribers. ",

Directors buy $100K-$500K for optics or because their governance guidelines require minimum holdings. It tells you nothing about next quarter.\n\nThe only insider signal were worth watching:\n- CEO/CFO buying >$1M with their own cash (not options)\n- Cluster buying (3+ insiders at the same time)\n- Size relative to compensation matters. For example a CFO buying $2M when they make $500K is a different signal than a board member buying $200K when they're worth $50M\n\nAlso point to note insider buying is generally a conviction signal about the next 12 months, not the next earnings print.\n\n### Methodology\n\n- 80 stocks that moved >3% on earnings (Jan 27 - Feb 13, 2026)\n- Insider data from EDGAR Form 4 filings, last 3 months\n- Only counted open market purchases (code P), not option exercises or grants\n- Price data from Polygon\n- Filtered to market cap >$100M\n\n",

I should probably diversify but that’s a topic for another post. \n\nThese next investments are what I copied off Reddit.\n\n**Charles Schwab Portfolio**\n\nIndividual: $50 weekly\n\n65% SCHB x76\n\n20% vxus x8\n\n5% schg x5\n\n5% avuv x2\n\n5% ibit x3\n\nRoth IRA: $50 weekly \n\n50% SCHB x37\n\n20% vxus x5\n\n10% schg x6\n\n10% avuv x2\n\n10% ibit x4\n\nThe Charles Schwab investments I have a decent understanding. It’s a good split between different commodities, maybe. I also realized I can only invest $7000 in a Roth IRA so gonna have to stop one or the other before that amount this year. Idk which to stop or if two is even necessary. At the moment once one hits $3,500 I’ll stop buying.\n\nI don’t have a clue what this Fidelity portfolio is for 😅\n\n**Fidelity Portfolio** \n\nIndividual: $100 weekly\n\n75% SPAXX x900\n\n25% SGOV x3\n\n👆What are those and why are they good?\n\n**GS Marcus HYSA** \n\n$150 weekly\n\nW/ $2k+\n\nIs a HYSA necessary even tho I have those Fidelity investments? Are these just about the same thing? \n\n**Cash**\n\nBofA checking \n\n$7k+\n\nI have a feeling I’ll be recommended to put $6k of my cash into one of the investment accounts and to leave the bare minimum for my life in checking. $1000 will do….\n\nI’m sure I’m off to a great start but just want a better understanding of it all that isn’t coming from ChatGPT \n\nThanks in advance!! 🙏",

        "body": "Alright so actual cash in BofA can be whatever you're comfortable with. I keep one month expenses plus enough to pay off whatever I spent on credit cards last month. Whatever it needs to be so that there's no risk of you overdrafting and it doesn't get so low it makes you nervous. \n\nAfter that get any 401k match available to you are work, in full\n\nAfter that pay off all debt above like 5% interest except a mortgage. \n\nAfter that comes savings. You are correct that your HYSA and your Fidelity account are essentially the same thing. Keep whichever you like best. This account has an emergency fund. An emergency fund is typically 3-6 months expenses. This is so if you lose your job or get injured or whatever you have time to figure it out. This can also take care of a major appliance breaking or car repairs or whatever. It's so when the worst happens you are not forced to take on debt. If your position in life is riskier (you have kids, spouse who doesn't work, unstable job situation, etc) you may want to keep as much as a year expenses here or even more. That's personal. You can also keep money here for known upcoming expenses or purchases in the next 5 years such as cars, houses, repairs, weddings, etc. If you go with the Fidelity account SPAXX would be a good place to keep the emergency fund because it doesn't fluctuate and you can get the money immediately. SGOV is a good place to keep everything else. If you live in a state with higher income tax FDLXX is better than SPAXX because it's fully state tax exempt. \n\nAfter that retirement accounts. 401k, Roth IRA, HSA, etc. I do not know the specifics of your pension but will just assume it's interchangeable. Really it's ideal to max these out, and it doesn't make much sense to invest in a taxable account until these are maxed. So contribute what you can. At your age Traditional is probably more tax efficient than Roth. Invest everything in a low fee target retirement date fund, or if you don't want bonds a low fee global index fund such as VT or a VTI/VXUS combo. That T. Rowe retirement date fund has reletively high fees. If it is in an IRA where you can buy anything, find one with lower fees. You want fees around or below ~0.2% ideally. Your entire 401k is currently in a US value fund. It's not the worst thing but you want value and growth, US and international. Diversification. \n\nAfter that comes taxable investments. Currently you are not maxing retirement accounts so I would suggest not having taxable investments. When you invest in tax advantaged accounts you get free money. Probably 20-30% more money depending on your tax rate, for free. So why invest in taxable and take the 20-30% hit? As for what you have in these accounts, there's no need for so many funds. Just buy VT or VTI and VXUS. Retirement date funds are not great in taxable because they generate a lot of dividends.",
